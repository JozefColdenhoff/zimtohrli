# Zimtohrli: A New Psychoacoustic Perceptual Metric for Audio Compression

Zimtohrli is a psychoacoustic perceptual metric that quantifies the human
observable difference in two audio signals in the proximity of
just-noticeable-differences.

In this project we study the psychological and physiological responses
associated with sound, to create a new more accurate model for measuring
human-subjective similarity between sounds.
The main focus will be on just-noticeable-difference to get most significant
benefits in high quality audio compression.
The main goals of the project is to further both existing and new practical
audio (and video containing audio) compression, and also be able to plug in the
resulting psychoacoustic similarity measure into audio related machine learning
models.
